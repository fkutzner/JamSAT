# JamSAT Dependencies

This directory contains git submodules for JamSAT dependencies that
get built along with JamSAT itself.

## Direct Dependencies
* [`state_ptr`](https://github.com/robbepop/state_ptr) is used to safely
store extra information in pointers.

## Testing Dependencies
* `googletest` is used as a general testing framework.
* `minisat` is used to validate JamSAT results in acceptance tests.
